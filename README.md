**Hypothalamus Volumes in Adolescent ME/CFS**

Code used for statistical analysis in _Hypothalamus volumes in adolescent Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Impact of self-reported fatigue and illness duration_ - Byrne et al. Please refer to the transcript for information about behavioural/clinical measures and MRI acquisition.

Hypothalamus volumes for this analysis were calculated using the following segmentation tool: https://github.com/BBillot/hypothalamus_seg (ref: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117287). 

Intracranial volume was calculated using the eTIV output from the FreeSurfer recon-all pipeline (https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/recon-all).
